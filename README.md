# Machine-Learning-Project-Gemstone-Price-Prediction
===============================================================================
## A machine learning based project on determining the price of the gemstones based on their features(listed below).
## Features of gemstones:
Carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.

cut : Quality of Diamond Cut

color : Color of Diamond With D being the best and J the worst.

clarity : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.

depth : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)

table : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.

x : length in mm

y : width in mm

z : height in mm
